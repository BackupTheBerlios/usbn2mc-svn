The project vport is mainly a usb device wich offers many different typical microcontroller interfaces.

You can access the ports in linux over the typical devices, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/i2c0 and so on,
or over the userspace based libusb.

Over the libusb you can talk with your devices also in Windows and Macintosh.
